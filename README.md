Description:

Conway's Game of Life, completed for my Data Structures course.


Rules of Game:
	
	1. Survival: Each cell that has two or three adjacent cells survives until the next generation.
	2. Death: Each cell that has at least four adjacent cells disappears (or dies) by overpopulation.
	   Also, each cell that has at most one adjacent cell dies by isolation.
	3. Birth: Each empty square (i.e., dead cell) that is adjacent to exactly three cells gives birth
	   to a new cell for the next generation.
